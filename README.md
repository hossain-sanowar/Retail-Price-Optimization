Description:
Introduction to Price Optimization

Pricing is an essential part of every company. A great deal of thinking goes into it. There are several approaches of estimating costs for various types of things. There are certain items whose sales are very sensitive to their costs, so that a little change in their price may result in a significant change in their sales. Additionally, there are goods whose sales are not much impacted by their value; these are often luxury items or needs (like certain medicines).
 
Price elasticity of demand (EPD), often known as elasticity, is the degree to which the compelling desire for something varies in relation to its price. In general, when the price of an item rises, people's demand for it decreases. However, for certain items, the buyers' demand may decrease significantly even with a little price rise, while for others, it may remain almost same even with a substantial price increase. Economists use the word elasticity to describe the sales' sensitivity to price changes. Specifically, price elasticity is the percentage change in quantity requested when the price increases by one percent, everything else being held constant.

Retail Price Optimization in Python

In this machine learning pricing optimization case study, we will use a cafe's historical sales data to determine the ideal prices for their products based on their price elasticity. The information is saved in a PostgreSQL database hosted by Amazon RDS. First, I will compute the price elasticity of each item, and then I will choose the best price. While analyzing a specific cafe's data, it is possible to price any product using this method. This machine learning retail pricing optimization project will concentrate on the past items.

Dynamic Pricing Dataset

The information is stored in three CSV files.
1.	Cafe - Sell MetaData.csv:This file contains information regarding the cafe's sales. Columns:Sell ID, Sell Category, Product ID, Product Name
2.	Cafe-Transaction- Store.csv: This file provides information on the cafe's transactions and sales receipts.Columns: Date, Price, Quantity, Sell Identifier, and Sell Category
3.	Cafe - DateInfo.csv: This contains date information pertaining to completed transactions.Columns: Date, Year, Holiday, Weekend, School Vacation, Temperature, and Outdoor

I will also apply how to get data from the Postgres database using the psycopg2 package and Python.

In this research, tools and techniques are used to optimize retail prices utilizing Machine Learning algorithms.

Price Optimization Algorithms

Understanding client behavior through analyzing sales data is essential for the success of any firm. Not only does it contribute to the improvement of product quality, but it also helps to determine the appropriate pricing for each product. For example, things seen as luxury items by the general public are offered at unreasonable prices. At this dynamic pricing Python project, I estimated the price of various food items in a caf√© based on prior sales data. In addition, I have used other price optimization strategies, such as cost-less pricing, competition-based pricing, perceived value pricing, and demand-based pricing. The notion of price elasticity, which plays a crucial role in estimating costs, is also presented in this project.
 
Exploratory Data Analysis

The price optimization dataset must be processed before it can be utilized for modeling. The dataset may have duplication that must be eliminated, and all variables of various data kinds must be presented on an equal footing. I used a burger restaurant's three sales, transaction, and date-related information for my study. I have used matplotlib and seaborn, Python packages for data visualization, to evaluate the dataset. This machine learning project for pricing optimization also includes instructions for combining datasets and preparing them for machine learning algorithm application using Pandas dataframes.

Machine Learning Algorithms

Instead of utilizing typical statistical approaches for price estimates, this project optimizes prices using Python and machine learning. I have used the regression trees and ordinary least square approach to determine the price elasticity of various items. I have also used how statistical factors such as the r-squared value are interpreted for analysis. The study also focuses on reducing certain variable values in order to increase the accuracy of the models. Moreover, profit maximization based on price elasticity assessment findings is investigated for this project.
Application of Machine Learning for Pricing Optimization in Python Project
This project is primarily concerned with optimizing the pricing of different goods sold at a burger restaurant. This price optimization in Python project is readily used by professionals in a variety of sectors, including medical, hospitality, insurance, etc. For instance, based on the input of prior hotel guests, an analyst may suggest modifying the cost of different services given by the hotel.
FAQs for Pricing Optimization with Machine Learning

1) How do you do Price Optimization?

One can apply different types of price optimization techniques like reducing cannibalization for inter and intra products of the same company, reducing cost drastically while playing a volume game etc.   

2) What is Price Optimization Machine learning?

Price Optimization can be achieved using regression machine learning algorithms like linear regression. One can first estimate the price elasticity for each product using the past sales data and then use that coefficient for price optimization.
